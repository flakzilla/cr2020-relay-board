# Yamaha CR-2020 relay board LC-67183-1 CAD Reproduction

This is a modern CAD replica of the LC-67183-1 (relay) circuit board from the power supply of a Yamaha CR-2020 reciever. It's hoped that this replica board can breathe new life into worn CR-2020s that may not otherwise be repairable.

## Summary

This project faithfully recreates the original board's layout, based on a sample LC-67183-1 board from a 1976 North American market CR-2020. A complete BOM (parts listing) is included to fully populate the board.

There are some small differences between certain model years, but as far as I can tell, this board should work for any model year. Check your CR-2020 carefully before trying to use this replacement.

This project does not try to:
* *perfectly* recreate original board - some liberties were taken to make the design more suitable for modern components, and to make some practical improvements that don't fundamentally change the 
* control costs
* reduce assembly effort
