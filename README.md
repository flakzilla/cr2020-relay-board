# Yamaha CR-2020 relay board LC-67183-1 CAD Reproduction

This is a modern CAD replica of the LC-67183-1 (relay) circuit board from the power supply of a Yamaha CR-2020 reciever. It's hoped that this replica board can breathe new life into CR-2020s that may not otherwise be repairable.

## Summary

This project faithfully recreates the original board based on a sample LC-67183-1 board from a 1976 North American market CR-2020. A complete BOM (parts listing) is included, including modern part substitutions where original parts may not be available. Instructions for ordering your own copies of the board from PCB manufacturer JLCPCB are included below.

Note that this replica doesn't *perfectly* recreate original board - some liberties were taken to make the design more suitable for modern components, and to make some practical improvements.

Replica filter capacitor boards have been developed as well:

Jayfree also designed a replacement for the relay board. It's a modern two-layer design instead of a reproduction of the original PCB: https://www.audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/cad-new-yamaha-cr-2020-capacitor-board.912553/page-7#post-14397551 ([Photo](https://www.audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/cad-new-yamaha-cr-2020-capacitor-board.912553/page-5#post-14284775))

### Caution & Advice

* Depending on your skill level, replacing the relay board can take many hours of effort.
* The entire process from start to finish is somewhat expensive depending on the prices you can get for the components.
* There are some small differences between certain model years, but as far as I can tell, this board should work for any model year. Check your CR-2020 carefully before trying to use this reproduction board.
* Carefully follow the instructions for producing the PCB. At least 2oz copper is required!
* A lead forming tool is helpful for assembling the board.

In general, you should read this thread on AK before going ahead: https://www.audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/cad-new-yamaha-cr-2020-capacitor-board.912553/

NOTE: the board uses silkscreen text that is too small. JLCPCB will manufacture it, but the results won't be perfect. A PDF export of the silkscreen markings is included for reference.

## How-To

### Summary
