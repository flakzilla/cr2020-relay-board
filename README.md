# Yamaha CR-2020 relay board LC-67183-1 CAD Reproduction

This is a modern CAD replica of the LC-67183-1 (relay) circuit board from the power supply of a Yamaha CR-2020 reciever. It's hoped that this replica board can breathe new life into CR-2020s that may not otherwise be repairable.

## Summary

This project faithfully recreates the original board based on a sample LC-67183-1 board from a 1976 North American market CR-2020. A complete BOM (parts listing) is included, including modern part substitutions where original parts may not be available.

Note that this replica doesn't *perfectly* recreate original board - some liberties were taken to make the design more suitable for modern components, and to make some practical improvements.

### Caution & Advice

* Depending on your skill level, replacing the relay board can take many hours of effort.
* The entire process from start to finish is somewhat expensive.
* There are some small differences between certain model years, but as far as I can tell, this board should work for any model year. Check your CR-2020 carefully before trying to use this reproduction board.
* Carefully follow the instructions for producing the PCB. At least 2oz copper is required!
* A lead forming tool is helpful for assembling the board.

## How-To

### Summary
Want to make one? Here's what to do:
1. Using the CAD files from this page, order a relay board from a PCB manufacturer (such as JLCPCB)
1. Order the parts from an electronics supplier (e.g. mouser or digikey)
1. Assemble the board
1. Install the board
